New Thread To All
=========================

If you typically always have the same email recipient lists for your projects, this button may be the right thing for you.
It creates a new mail compose window with to, cc, bcc filled with names from the currently viewed email, but starting a new thread.


Previously: Instead of compiling a new recipients list, we pressed 'reply to all'. 
Then we changed subject, body, attachments.  Easier than pulling 10 recipients into a new email.

Drawback: this new email was still part of the same conversation/thread as the old emails. Not desirable, if this new email is starting a 
new thread for a new project/incident/service question.

Now: just press 'new thread to all'. It will open a compose window with all previous email recipients, but will start a new thread.
